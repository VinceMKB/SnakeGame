# Retro Snake Game

## Description
This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game. 
It is built using C++ and the Raylib graphics library. 
In the game, the player controls a snake to collect food, increasing the snake's length with each piece of food consumed. The game continues until the snake collides with the edges of the game area or with itself.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Score tracking with each food item increasing the score.
- Game resets automatically upon collision, allowing quick restarts.
- Aesthetic, minimalistic graphics and controls.

## Dependencies
I would suggest running this on Visual Studio Code since it is what I used.
To run this game, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Raylib installed on your system.

## Installation and Setup
- **Step 1**: Download the zippped folder for this project. Navigate to the location of the zipped (compressed) folder using File Explorer.  
- **Step 2**: Right-click on the zipped folder, then select "Extract All..." from the context menu.  
- **Step 3**: In the dialog that appears, choose where you want the extracted files to be placed. By default, Windows will suggest extracting them to a folder with the same name as the zipped file, in the same location.  
- **Step 4**: Click the "Extract" button to start the extraction process. Once it's done, you can open the destination folder to access the extracted files.
- **Step 5**: Click on the file named "main" with file type "Code Workspace"

## Post Installation and Setup
If you using Visual Studio Code you can just press F5 to run application
