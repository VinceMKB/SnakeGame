# Retro Snake Game
## Description
This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game. 
It is built using C++ and the Raylib graphics library. 
In the game, the player controls a snake to collect food, increasing the snake's length with each piece of food consumed. The game continues until the snake collides with the edges of the game area or with itself.
